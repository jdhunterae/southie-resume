Visionary feline entrepreneur, self-declared academic prodigy,
and master of the almost-legal. Armed with a pawful of dubious
degrees and a head full of questionable ideas, Southie J.
Pinkerton has spent his career boldly venturing where no
cat should--and refusing to admit defeat when he inevitably
gets caught. Whether revolutionizing the pickle industry,
redefining feline entertainment, or simply yelling his way
out of lawsuits, Southie brings unshakable confidence, creative
schemes, and a strong talent for fleeing the scene.
